## Instructions

Bamazon is an app that allows you to purchase goods.
When the app is initiated, the user is asked which, of the availaible items, they would like to purchase. 

Using the arrow keys, the user highlights the item they wish to purchase and pushes enter to select it.

The user is then asked how many items they would like to purchase. If there are enought of the items in stock, the purchase goes through and the user is told how much money they owe.  If there isn't enough of that certain item in stock, the user is sent back to the beginning and told that we currently don't have enough of the desired item in stock.
